        Monaco is a microstate at the French Riviera with a population of approximately 40,000. The place basically only
        serves as a tax haven for wealthy people, and it's full of luxury yachts, cars, stores, and hotels. If you want
        to feel poor for one day, you should definitely go there!

        <p>I stayed at an Airbnb in Menton, a town located next to Monaco, as Monaco is basically unaffordable for a
          student. From there you can get to Monaco by train, bus, or car.</p>

        <p>This is the place to go if youâ€™ want to feel poor. I saw individuals there throwing away more than â‚¬10,000 in
          a single night. The casino has a dress code, which you can find on their website. In the evening, the place in
          front of the casino serves as a parking lot for luxury cars. The casino is over 200 years old and looks very
          prestigious inside. Taking photos there is prohibited, but I did it anyway, as I always do. ðŸ˜Š </p>
